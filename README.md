# TranslateX

TranslateX is a powerful and easy-to-use application that allows users to **upload files (Images, PDFs, Audio, Word documents)**, **extract text**, **translate** it into regional languages (Hindi, Marathi, Bengali, Gujarati, Tamil, Telugu), and **save** the output as a **Word Document** (`.docx`) or **Audio File** (`.mp3`).

The app is built using **Tkinter** for GUI, and uses **Tesseract OCR**, **Speech Recognition**, **Google Translate**, and **gTTS** (Google Text-to-Speech).
